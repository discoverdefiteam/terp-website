# Test Network Update: Athena-2
*Written on Nov 4, 2022*
___
Weâ€™ve been hard at work over the past few weeks, and [Terp-Core](https://github.com/terpnetwork/terp-core) is going through internal audit processes. In the meantime, to give our earliest community members a taste of what interacting with Terp Network applications fees like, we want to introduce some on chain events while we finalize preparations for main net!

## Scavenger Hunt 

The scavenger hunt is an ongoing event that gives anyone an opportunity to participate & become eligible for the Terp & Persy Fairdrop. During this period, node operators, developers, and community members can receive rewards (up to 6% of the total supply) for helping to secure, sustain, and grow Terp Network and the Terp- Core ecosystem.

Members of the TerpNET Foundation will track contributions on a **points based system**, and in order to minimize any attempts to corrupt or game this event, specific terms on what makes one ineligible , as well as eligible can be found [here](https://github.com/terpnetwork/scavenger-hunt).

The first phase has been critical, those contributing to node & infrastructure work together to stress-test & prepare Terp Network for our network launch. Moving into the second phase we can focus on involving more community members that intend to be end users of applications, and eager to learn more.

Actions planned to be tracked by the TerpNET Foundation include:
- Depositing THIOL to designated wallet
- Voting on select TestNET DAO proposals
- Interacting with select applications on chain

## How to Participate?
First things first, you will need a [Keplr](https://keplr.app) wallet, or another interchain compatible wallet. *The browser extension is recommended for the time being.*

Once you have your Keplr installed to participate , head over to https://github.com/terpnetwork/testnet and follow the instructions in README.md. Our Discord also has a dedicated Scavenger Hunt category for all things test-net. If you still have any issues getting up and running, come talk to the team over in #technical-questions!

## About Terp Network

As a base layer blockchain, applications can be built on top of Terp-Core to access cross chain utility & liquidity. The Terp Network Blockchain facilitates interoperability between the Cosmos ecosystem, Ethereum network, side chain architectures, layer two scaling solutions, and alternative base layer protocols.*
