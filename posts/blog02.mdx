# Pre Genesis Reflection
*“Without reflection, we go blindly on our way, creating more unintended consequences, and failing to achieve anything useful.” — Margaret J. Wheatley*
#### This article provides a look into the past of the history of Terp Network, from the perspective of one of our community contributors. As we reflect on our journey together, it is important to acknowledge our successes, learn from our mistakes, and confront the challenges that lie ahead.

## Successes
### Finding The Path
Terp Network test-net started producing blocks in early August of 2022. This test network effort allowed contributors to gather first hand knowledge & understanding of Terp Network , so that we can then brainstorm & begin to shape Terp Network into what it can be.

Treating the test network as a production network gave us much more clarity on the scope of integrating to building Terp Network within their operations. I am proud of how we are able to find solutions and experience nuances that takes place while utilizing the SDK, we believe this collective experience will serve valuable for realizing the adoption of a verifiable, community-owned server.

It is a true privilege being a community within the Interchain (and really contributing in a decentralized ecosystem) because many of our peers are true mavericks of their expertise, aligning energy, efforts, & contributions aligned with the greater good of the collective Interchain community. The relationships formed during time spent finding the best fit for network operation has created a very clear path forward, and I consider these our communities greatest strength.

### Mitigating Risk 

Terp Network existence is an opportunity for our culture to mitigate risk through cryptography, governance, & sovereign ownership. It becomes more clear as we progress that there is a diverse range of surface area for risk, and that risk management will always be dynamic.

The SDK that powers Terp Network is proven, dare to say revolutionary risk management software. We are confident that because of the tooling we utilize, when risk management challenges arise, we can raise awareness & mediate risk as best as we can. To just bullet point the main areas of risk:
- **End User Risk** — Key management, Social Manipulation, Local Regulation
- **Application Layer Risk** — Malicious Code Implementation, Phishing Attempts
- **Consensus Risk** — 51% Takeover, 2/3 Byzantine Fault Tolerance

We have learned & anticipating to implement improvements over the long term that address an mitigate each of these layers of risk.

## Lessons

### Ensuring Progressive Decentralization 

The impact of the decentralized, open-source software movement has transformed entire industries and empowered millions of people around the world. Not unique to software & technology, the preservation values of decentralization is echoed throughout the history of civilizations.

For example, during the reign of the Tang Dynasty in China in the 9th century, Buddhism and other religions were under persecution. Sacred temples & artifacts were destroyed, property was confiscated, and practicing members were expelled from China.

Despite this, the decentralized structure of Buddhism allowed the religion to survive and even thrive in China despite this persecution. This decentralization allowed Buddhism to adapt to changing circumstances and evade terrible persecution. Many practicing monks and nuns went into hiding or fled to other parts of China, where they continued to practice and spread their teachings. Decentralization will always be source of resilience and adaptation in the face of persecution and oppression, and with Terp Network we are build together decentralized, in the face of the global oppression of the individual.

### Make the most out of every success

### Clearing The Path for others
To help others begin their journey of decentralization, there are many things that we can do to improve how we will moving forward. It all starts with the basics — a positive environment where resources can be available for any level of understanding.

### Communication is just as important as code
There are challenges that exist on the social layer of on-chain governance and consensus that stem from how the user experience of communication within the project itself. If the experience of participating is not inviting, is time-consuming, and is not quite concise on what is actually being proposed, then we are prescribing a stagnant growth supplement to our future. Where the conversations take place, how manageable following governance proposal standards are, and various templates of participation is something we can collaborate and improve on moving forward.

## Challenges

### Coordination
As we grow in numbers, how we collaborate with each other will constantly evolve. An amazing example of healthy collaboration techniques was provided by informal systems, called [Workflow](https://workflow.informal.systems/).
### Innovation
The challenge exist to iterate the infrastructure layer needed for our culture. This challenge will require both coordination on the prioirty of solutions, the method of approach, and virtually every other component of making this reality.

It is a pleasure to be a part of a growing community, we accept this challenge and are looking forward to taking this journey on The Path with each of you all.
