# Main-Net Overview — Terp Network

## The vision of Terp Network
As a blockchain community, the vision of [Terp Network](https://terp.network) is one of a verifiable, and decentralized platform for those in the cannabis culture to have greater freedom to innovate & find solutions to issues present in this culture.

With full [interoperability to all major cryptocurrency networks](https://mapofzones.com/home?columnKey=ibcVolume&period=24h), Terp Network is a unique opportunity to accelerate adoption of sovereign & privacy aligned techniques. Terp Network is a robust, efficient, low-cost smart contract platform owned by the community, powering transparency & verifiability.

## Main Net: Morocco-1
We are currently in the beginning phases of governance for verifying the [details of main-net launch](https://github.com/terpnetwork/genesis-prelaunch). Below provides a high level overview of the goals of main-net launch and following main-net launch.

Core to Terp Network’s platform is a token economic model that uses 2 native tokens. Terp Token (TERP) & Thiol Token (THIOL), power governance operations & incentives structures accelerating growth, respectively.

Morocco-1 is the proposed launch of Terp Network. Morocco-1 enables basic staking & governance operations, including the ability to delegate to validators & vote on governance proposals.

An initial maximum set of 69 validators will be able to stabilize the staking set & establish economic value. TERP holders will then vote to enable various modules & features of Terp Network.

## What’s Next?

Once Morocco-1 is live, TERP holders will be able to vote on any governance proposal on chain. Some examples of types of governance proposals that can happen on chain:
- **Network Parameter Changes:**
- ** Text-based Proposals: Request For Consensus 
Temperature check how Terp delegators feel on a subject.
- **Protocol Software Upgrades:** 
Future proof via modularity. Functions of Terp Network can be added or improved by decision of governance, giving everyone an opportunity to shape Terp Network’s functionality.

As we continue the acceleration of Terp Network this year, we look forward to sharing more updates with you.
