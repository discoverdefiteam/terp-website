# Main-net is live! Terp Network

Today we are excited to announce that Terp Network is live! As of right now, users can:
- delegate TERP to validators
- interact with every permissionless feature of terp-core, the software that powers Terp Network

This is an historic occasion! For the first time ever, a **public decentralized protocol for cannabis culture** with **no private investors, no VC money,** and **no pre-sale** was bootstrapped, and now interoperable with most other decentralized protocols.

This represents a significant milestone in the shift toward digital soverignty & collaboration within this era of our cultureâ€™s. The goal for Terp Network was to create a way to improve self-soverignty for community members, but without sacraficing interoperability & verifiability with [inter-blockchain communication (IBC)](https://ibcprotocol.org/).

### TerpNET roadmap for the next 3 months

Over the next few weeks and months, there will be a number of rapid protocol updates.

Expected around the end of April (depending on governance), the TerpNET Foundation DAO plans a number of proposals including smart contract uploads & software modification requests.

## Interchain Relaying 
Initially, anyone may open an IBC channel to any interoperable ecosytem, as shown in the awesome visualizers provided by MapOfZones & Mintscan. The TerpNET Foundation aims to feegrant relaying cost to any inital relayer just reach out in the discord! This will make Terp Network interoperable with interchain applications!
