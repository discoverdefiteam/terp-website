## What is IBC?
Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC for short) is a fancy term for a protocol that lets different blockchain networks talk to each other. The IBC protocol provides a permissionless way for relaying data between blockchains, unlike most trusted bridging technologies. The security of IBC reduces to the security of the participating chains.

This is massive! IBC is like building a superhighway connecting different countries, but in the digital world.

*Cross-chain token transfers?* Check! *Cross-chain staking?* Check! *Cross-chain marketplaces?* Check! With IBC you can even create new decentralized applications that span **multiple networks**.

IBC is a core module of Terp Network, which means a truly cross chain future is inevitable
